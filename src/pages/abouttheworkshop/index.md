If the Internet were a city, what would be its roads, buildings, and parks? How do people, businesses and governing bodies produce insights into the qualitative characteristics of distribution beyond the tired triptych of centralized, decentralized, and distributed?

In this hands-on workshop, we'll examine decentralized forms of networking through the lenses of cities, urbanism, and architecture. In small groups, participants will be provided with “urban” elements to construct landscapes that tease out models of decentralization and governance for the “Internet as a city.”

We will extend this exploration to modes of governance in decision making, and notions of “public space” or the commons.
