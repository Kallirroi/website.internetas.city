The workshop was led by:

Agnes Cameron (MIT Media Lab) <br>
Kalli Retzepi (MIT Media Lab) <br>
Sam Ghantous (MIT Architecture) <br>
Zhexi Zhang (MIT ACT programme) <br>

Thank you to Mindy Seu and Sam Hart for inviting us, and to all the people we met while there, particularly the Cybernetics Library (Daniel) and the Gardens (Melanie, Dan, Callil).

The building blocks have been adopted by a grade school teacher in SF. We hope they are happy in their new home.
