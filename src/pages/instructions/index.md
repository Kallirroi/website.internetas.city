We thought it would be nice to provide the lasercutting templates and instructions on folding, in case someone wants to reproduce the workshop. We went through a long process of trial and error in order to arrive to these primitive shapes (long process mostly led by Sam Ghantous), since we wanted to maximize the potential of the lasercutter bed. We could have produced bigger pieces, but it would require glueing parts together, which we decided to avoid. 

### Materials
We went with e-flute cardboard since it was easier to fold. The most commonly used cardboard is c-flute (1/8 inch), but we went with e-flute (1/16 inch) for the folding as well as the fact that being lighter, we could transport more sheets on the plane. (Yes we prepared everything in Cambridge and then flew it to San Francisco).

We purchased $460 worth of cardboard (200 sheets) from our local arts store but we didn't use all of it. 

### Lasercutting
Link to the Rhino files with the unrolled objects (3D -> 2D for laser cutting).

Rhino layers color coding explained below:
- red
- cyan
- magenta
- green


### Spraypainting
If you want to spray paint the cardboard, we suggest you do it right after the laser cutting step is done (and before you remove the cut cardboard from the sheet). We used the following spray paints:
- one
- two
- three
